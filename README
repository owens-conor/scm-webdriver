This project aims to automate the processing of the Standing order payments into the Sailing Club Manager program.

To use it:
1. Download the bank statement as CSV. Sort by narative1(A-Z), then by Date(oldest to newest)
2. ruby ./readfile.rb BANKFILE invoice_lookup [ALL|banknarrative1nameO] [no_proxy]

Still to do:
1. Automate generation of the invoice_lookup. This is difficult as there is no direct match of the bank narative1 to GBSC account.
